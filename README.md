# IIN-3007 Final Project
# Predicting Breast Cancer Outcomes using Machine Learning Algorithms
## Authors: Emily Mosquera (329983) and Dominique Farf√°n (328313)
### Project Description: Machine Learning applied to a medical dataset. 
This project aims to predict patient survival outcomes using four machine learning algorithms: XG Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. We performed hyperparameter optimization with Grid Search and Randomized Search, and literary review for the implementation. We evaluated models using metrics like Recall, Precision, AUC-ROC, and F1-Score, focusing on minimizing misclassification risks in a medical (cancer) context.

The analysis included:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Handling class imbalance using resampling techniques.
- Hyperparameter optimization using Random Search and Grid Search.
- Evaluation using multiple performance metrics: Precision, Recall, Specificity, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability.
The goal was to select and fine-tune the best model based on the needs of a cancer diagnosis setting, where balancing precision and recall is critical.
